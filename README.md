>Ionic is the beautiful, free and open source mobile SDK for developing native and progressive web apps with ease.

* [Google Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/)
 > Web Starter Kit is an opinionated boilerplate for web development. Tools for building a great experience across many devices and performance oriented. Helping you to stay productive following the best practices outlined in Google's Web Fundamentals. A solid starting point for both professionals and newcomers to the industry.

* [Go](https://golang.org/)

* [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/)
>GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
  - Server Side - [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)
  - Client Side - [apollodata](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/)

* [Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/) -  We will be using the demo payment request API implementation describe [here](https://mobiforge.com/design-development/mobile-payments-with-the-payment-request-api)
